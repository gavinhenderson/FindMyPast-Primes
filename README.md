My attempt at the coding challenge issued by FindMyPast
## About
An application that takes in a number value from the user and will then output the multiplication table of prime numbers. The project will focus on using tests throughout the development. The project will be written using javascript.

## How to run it
You need it install all the the node modules. This can be done using the node package manager. To install the dependencies enter:
